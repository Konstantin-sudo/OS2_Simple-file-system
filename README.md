Simple File System (FS)
- FS that works with one partition and multiple clients
- Using bit vector for allocation and indexed sequential file organization (2 levels)
- Realized functions within FS:  mounting a file system, formatting a new file system, creating files(opening files), reading and writing into files, etc.
- Used C++ language to build the solution
